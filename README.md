# proteomics_analysis

Back up your proteomics data every time you run an experiment!

## Data management
### 1. Create a project folder for each experiment you run
The folder should be named in three parts:        
1. A project name - Name your project in a meaningful way
2. Put your initials
3. Put the month and year you run this experiment

For example, in May 2022, Alice Smith wanted to run a proteomics experiment in antibiotic resistant of KT2440.      
First, she should create a personal folder in 'C:/Xcalibur/data' as 'AliceSmith'.      
Second, in her personal folder, she should create a project folder for this experiment called 'ABRKT2440_May2022'. 
### 2. Create a metadata table
This should be the most important document that make everyone including yourself to understand the experimental design. Each project should have its own metadata table. It should be informative, and precisely labeled. 
It can be saved into any of the file formats of your choice. 

For example, Alice had an experiment with three replicates of each control and treatment group, she should have a metadata table like this:
